Variables and Objects Exercises

1. The first expression wants to know if the two objects are 
    the same type, length and value. The second expression wants
    to know if they point to the same object in memory.

2. Line 1 is a set, literal, which is mutable (know this because no
    literal form of a frozen set). It contains a typle as an element.
    Line 2 is a pointer to line in memory. therfore when you modify 
    set1, set2 also gets changed. same goes if you were to modify set2. 
    So the output should be {42, 'Monty Python' ('a', 'b', 'c'), range(5,10)}
    in any order. 

3. I want to say it will print 42, because we haven't just assigned 
    another variable to the object in dict1. we've used the dict function.
    We have created a new dictionary by using that function. 
    NOTE: I was correct in the WHY. But I read the wrong line in the code
    and chose the wrong value. Correct answer is The Life of Brian, but I
    was wrong for dyslexic reasons, and not for anything to do with 
    understanding how Python works. 

4. [1, 42, 3] because the dict construct creates a shallow copy. the two
    objects are not the same, but their (values?) are shared.

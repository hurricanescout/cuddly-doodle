exercise6

'foo' == 'Foo'
evaluates to false
reason is f > F 
(lexigraphically, lower case are greater than uppercase)
therefore expression cannot be true
therefore expression is false. 

Exercise 7 

Return an error because it is an invalid literal.
Would return 3 if it was a float in the parentheses

Exercise 8

'12' < '9' 

Evaluates to true, because in first character of string, 9>1
At that point python stops evaluating and returns a response
